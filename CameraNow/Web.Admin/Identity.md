| UserToken   | Represents an authentication token for a user.          |

| RoleClaim   | Represents a claim that's granted to all users within a role. |

# Entity type relationships
The entity types are related to each other in the following ways:

Each User can have many UserClaims.
Each User can have many UserLogins.
Each User can have many UserTokens.
Each Role can have many associated RoleClaims.
Each User can have many associated Roles, and each Role can be associated with many Users. 
This is a many-to-many relationship that requires a join table in the database. 
The join table is represented by the UserRole entity.
